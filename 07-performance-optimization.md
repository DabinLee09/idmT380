## AI AND ML ENABLED ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF WEBSITE
*paper review*

Research Question/Goal : 
How to identify the right customer details and expectations by using Website optimization and analytics techniques.

- **website optimization:** the process of tuning the structure of the website contents
- **Web analytics:** applied to website to understand site visitor's behaviour or user expectations

### AI Tools Researched
**Google Analytics:**
Widely used for tracking website traffic and user behavior. It provides insights into acquisition, behavior, and conversion metrics, helping in understanding user interactions and improving website performance.

**Kissmetrics:**
Focuses on user behavior analytics, allowing businesses to track visitor activities and engagement over time, providing a detailed understanding of user journeys.

**Adobe Analytics:**
Collects visitor information from multiple channels such as search engines, social media, and blog posts, offering comprehensive analytics to understand customer needs.

**Chatbots (Voice-based and Text-based):**
Automated bots that interact with users to provide instant responses and support. These bots are powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries efficiently.


# The Reason They Selected These Tools:
1. These tools are industry standard and used in many sites to analyze and optimize website performance.
2. These tools offer comprehensive analytics and insights that are essential for understanding user behavior and preferences.
3. The integration of chatbots provides a practical solution for improving customer interaction and support without human intervention.


### Implementation & Testing
**Google Analytics:**
Implemented GA on the SSM Academy website to track visitor activities. The setup included real-time analytics goals, user acquisition tracking, and engagement metrics analysis. The tool provided valuable insights into user behavior, which helped in optimizing the website structure and content.
Successes: 
Accurate tracking of user interactions, improved understanding of user acquisition channels, and enhanced engagement metrics.
Challenges: Initial setup complexity and the need for continuous monitoring to ensure data accuracy.
Kissmetrics: Used to analyze long-term user behavior and engagement patterns. The tool helped in identifying key areas for improvement in user experience.

Successes: Detailed insights into user journeys and behavior over time, helping in refining marketing strategies.
Challenges: Integration with other tools and systems required additional effort.
Adobe Analytics: Deployed to gather data from various channels, providing a holistic view of visitor interactions. The tool's comprehensive analytics helped in understanding customer preferences and improving marketing efforts.

Successes: Comprehensive data collection and analysis from multiple sources, better understanding of customer needs.
Challenges: High learning curve and complexity in configuring the tool to suit specific business needs.
Chatbots: Implemented voice-based and text-based chatbots on the website to handle customer queries and support. The bots used NLP techniques to understand and respond to user inputs accurately.

Successes: Significant reduction in response time, 24/7 customer support, and improved user satisfaction.
Challenges: Initial training of the bots to handle a wide range of queries and ensuring continuous improvement based on user interactions.



### Evaluation of Tools
**MidJourney**
- Prompt can create very detailed input in high quality.
- It can create any kind of great asset with detailed promt but only in the photo.
- It would be more powerful if it used as a sketch or moodboard of design work.

Â 
**Meshy**
- Prompt did not understanded detailed input. 
- It provided three type of art style(realistic, low-poly, cartoon), however the overall quality of the work was low-mid.
- the more detiled the it put is, it takes long time and some of the written details are ignored.
- Good for test work.

**3D CSM ai**
- Photo to 3d was useful, however it was hard to modify created work.
- Can not choose the style on photo to 3d. If input is photo of real Statue of Liberty, it will created realistic asset. If you want to create Statue of Liberty in cartoon style or change the color of certain part, then you will need to create photo of what you want and upload the  image.


**Key Challenges**
- Can modify very small part of generated 3d asset(colors, size, etc)


### Conclusion
Overall the quality of 3d work is very low and possible art style was not much variable. If it is photo based the it will rely very much on the photos but when it turn 2d to 3d, it lost few deail or confuse the element. So the output can be merged some times to times. Also, it is hard to modify in given web-based program. I haven't imported this into the real 3d tools but it seems export as a one object(if character is wearing clothes, you cannot separate them). These tools can be used for example of concept, sketch, or mood board. It wasn't satisfactory to use for actual work
