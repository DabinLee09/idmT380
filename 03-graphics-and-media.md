## 3D Asset Generator

Research Question/Goal : 
How can we make 3d Icon/Asset quickly without using 3D tools(Blender 3D, Unity, Unreal Engin, Maya, etc)

### AI Tools Researched
1. MidJourney
2. Meshy
3. 3D CSM ai

### Implementation & Testing
Create 3D Asset by putting inout of photo or  text descrition

**Test Features**
A. Desk
Generate a 3D asset of work desk with high polygon LOD. Apple Macbook, books, paintings and iced coffee is on the desk. creative vive with pastel tone. Painting is pastel tone oil painting. Books are stacked and painting is looks like lean on the wall. macbook background is painting of milky way. Iced americano is next to the flower vase. flower is gredient of pink-white with little bit of red touch. Desk color is ligth wood tone. Arrange it on a plain white background

B. 3D Icon
Generate a 3D icon. icons will be hamburger menu, camera, sound, and settings. Hologram, neon, transparent vive.
Arrange it on a plain black background.


### Function of Tools
**MidJourney**
- Prompt based image generator. 
- Can generate photo of 3d asset.

 
**Meshy**
- Prompt based 3D asset generator.
- It has Image to 3D function but it is paid feature.


**3D CSM ai**
- Prompt based image generator. 
- Photo based 3D asset generator.
- Create photo of 3d asset, and generate 3D asset by created photo uploaded photo.

  
 
### Evaluation of Tools
**MidJourney**
- Prompt can create very detailed input in high quality.
- It can create any kind of great asset with detailed promt but only in the photo.
- It would be more powerful if it used as a sketch or moodboard of design work.

 
**Meshy**
- Prompt did not understanded detailed input. 
- It provided three type of art style(realistic, low-poly, cartoon), however the overall quality of the work was low-mid.
- the more detiled the it put is, it takes long time and some of the written details are ignored.
- Good for test work.

**3D CSM ai**
- Prompt based image generator. 
- Photo based 3D asset generator.
- Create photo of 3d asset, and generate 3D asset by created photo uploaded photo.


**Key Challenges**
- Can modify very small part of generated asset(colors, size, etc)
- 


### Conclusion
Overall, both tools was very helpful for the fast prototyping. However it would need more work if user want to create high-fi prototype.
I would used Uizard to do the wireframing and low fi usabilty test. Then export this into figma and develop the visual design.
