## Data Visualization Analysis Based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Survey
*paper review*

### Research Question/Goal : 
How does AI enhance data visualization by automating data preprocessing, identifying hidden patterns, recommending appropriate visualizations, enabling natural language interaction, supporting real-time data visualization, and generating predictive visualizations? 


### AI Tools Researched
#### Data2Vis:
Data2Vis treats the data visualization recommendation task as a sequence-to-sequence translation task, providing insights into automated visualization generation based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BiRNN).

#### VizML:
VizML considers numerous data features relevant to visualization design, offering a broader perspective on how neural network models can learn automatic visualization recommendations from millions of real-world data.

#### Table2Charts:
Table2Charts supports rendering final results in various visual languages, making it a versatile tool for understanding data-to-visual template transformation through deep Q-learning.

#### SEQ2VIS:
SEQ2VIS uses a natural language query sequence as input, producing data visualization query language outputs, providing a practical application of deep learning for visual recommendation systems.

#### Dziban:
Dziban considers the properties of anchor visualization results when recommending current visualizations, helping in understanding continuous visual recommendation.



### Implementation & Testing
#### Data2Vis:

- **Successes**: Efficient in generating visualization sequences from data sequences. Demonstrated the potential of sequence-to-sequence models for visualization recommendations.
- **Challenges**: Initial setup was time-consuming due to the vast amount of data and tool complexity. Required a learning curve to fully utilize all features.

#### VizML: 
- **Successes**: Enhanced content relevance and readability, leading to increased user engagement. Provided clear, actionable recommendations for content improvement.
- **Challenges**: Integration with existing content management systems required additional configuration. Balancing keyword density with natural language was sometimes challenging.

#### Table2Charts: 
 - **Successes**: Provided real-time data on ranking fluctuations, allowing for timely adjustments. Offered detailed insights into competitor rankings and SERP dynamics.
- **Challenges**: Data interpretation required a deep understanding of SEO metrics. High volume of data sometimes made it difficult to pinpoint specific areas for improvement.



### Evaluation of Tools
- #### SEMrush:
  Highly effective in identifying and implementing relevant keywords. Improved overall content quality and search visibility.
  
  **Challenges**: High complexity and learning curve.
- #### Clearscope:
  Significant improvement in content optimization and user engagement. Enhanced keyword relevance and readability.
  
  **Challenges**: Integration and balancing natural language with keyword usage.
- #### AccuRanker:
  Excellent for real-time monitoring and competitor analysis. Detailed insights into SERP trends.

  **Challenges**: Requires expertise in SEO metrics for effective use.




### Conclusion
Using SEO tools directly felt a bit challenging, so I decided to conduct paper research. This paper reviews current SEO technologies and proposes how SEO technology could develop with AI in the future, which I found interesting and decided to review. The researchers did not directly use the tools mentioned above but evaluated them in the form of a case study. The Future AI-based SEO methods proposed in this paper are as follows:

1. Improving Local Search Accuracy
2. Optimizing SEO for Mobile Devices
3. Enhancing Personalization of Search Results
4. Democratizing SEO
5. Addressing Ethical Implications

Overall, AI is primarily used for content analysis in SEO, and unlike generative AI, a clear understanding of why AI is being used and what improvements are desired is essential for effectively leveraging AI in SEO.
