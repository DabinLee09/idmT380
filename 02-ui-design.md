## Survey Data Analysis by AI

Research Question/Goal : 
What can AI do for the UI design

### AI Tools Researched
1. Uizard
2. Visily AI

### Implementation & Testing
Use AI tools and create wireframe and mock ups for the App. Find out how far AI can do.

**App Features**
- Study timer app for university student.
- calendar and time table for Fixed schedule.
- To do list for track the assignments

**App Theme**

: Simple hand-drawn style. pastel or lively tone with cute typography


### Function of Tools
**1. Uizard**
- Prompt and photo based UI generator. 
- Can generate wireframe and low-fi mock up
- Can work on the interactions.
- Can convert photo into wireframe or color theme.
- Can generate dummy texts and images.

 
**2. Visily AI**
- Photo-based UI element generator.
- Can convert photo into wireframe or color theme.
- Can generate dummy texts and images.
 
 
### Evaluation of Tools
**1. Uizard**
- Prompt-based functions(Generating wireframe and theme) felt very powerful.
- It was hard to change the given design, but it was helpful to create new design.
- It can easily change the tone and concept, however the themes were similar and colors are basic.
- Support interactions as well so this can be used for wireframe usability test.


**2. Visily AI**
- Photo-based functions(convert photo to wireframe, etc) was useful.
- It would be useful if user have specific concept and reference.
- Provide prototyping mode so this can be used in low-fi to mid-fi prototyping.
- Photo and text generator helped fill the content.
- Design tools are not very powerful.


**Key Challenges**
- AI's capabilities are all different
- Not many AIs provide auto Design and prompt interaction.
- User have to know what they want specipically.


### Conclusion
Overall, both tools was very helpful for the fast prototyping. However it would need more work if user want to create high-fi prototype.
I would used Uizard to do the wireframing and low fi usabilty test. Then export this into figma and develop the visual design.
