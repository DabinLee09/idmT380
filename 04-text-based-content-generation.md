### Evaluation of Tools
**Claude**
1. Did contain the word I requested. The format of writing was not a essay format.
2. Matched the format but the word count was not(761 words). The flow was similar to that I planed it, but it needs more detail.
3. It does not have access to the internet links, cannot process img file in pdf. Therefore there are some obstacle to get a exact definition or content user planed. 
4. Expexted new flow for the content, but 1,2, and 4 output was very similar. Example were changed but metaphor or structures are very same.

- If there are no findings, the frequency of making words is less than that of GPT
- Tone was more less ai then GPT
- Branded Ui seems very delicate, felt like Claude is more focused on the writing(human language) not problem solving(coding, anwsering questions)

 
**Chat GPT 4**

4. Expexted new flow for the content, but 1,2, and 4 output was very similar. Example were changed but metaphor or structures are very same.

- The tone was very GPT.

**Key Challenges**
- Hard to fit the word count.
- Need to guide structure for the essay and write specifically.


### Conclusion
Overall the quality of 3d work is very low and possible art style was not much variable. If it is photo based the it will rely very much on the photos but when it turn 2d to 3d, it lost few deail or confuse the element. So the output can be merged some times to times. Also, it is hard to modify in given web-based program. I haven't imported this into the real 3d tools but it seems export as a one object(if character is wearing clothes, you cannot separate them). These tools can be used for example of concept, sketch, or mood board. It wasn't satisfactory to use for actual work
