### Function of Tools
**Cloude**

- Can generate photo of 3d asset.

 
**Chat GPT 4**
- Prompt based 3D asset generator.
- It has Image to 3D function but it is paid feature.


**Jenni Ai**
- Prompt based image generator. 
- Photo based 3D asset generator.
- Create photo of 3d asset, and generate 3D asset by created photo uploaded photo.

### Evaluation of Tools
**Cloude**
- Prompt can create very detailed input in high quality.
- It can create any kind of great asset with detailed promt but only in the photo.
- It would be more powerful if it used as a sketch or moodboard of design work.

 
**Chat GPT 4**
- Prompt did not understanded detailed input. 
- It provided three type of art style(realistic, low-poly, cartoon), however the overall quality of the work was low-mid.
- the more detiled the it put is, it takes long time and some of the written details are ignored.
- Good for test work.

**Jenni Ai**
- Photo to 3d was useful, however it was hard to modify created work.
- Can not choose the style on photo to 3d. If input is photo of real Statue of Liberty, it will created realistic asset. If you want to create Statue of Liberty in cartoon style or change the color of certain part, then you will need to create photo of what you want and upload the  image.


**Key Challenges**
- Can modify very small part of generated 3d asset(colors, size, etc)


### Conclusion
Overall the quality of 3d work is very low and possible art style was not much variable. If it is photo based the it will rely very much on the photos but when it turn 2d to 3d, it lost few deail or confuse the element. So the output can be merged some times to times. Also, it is hard to modify in given web-based program. I haven't imported this into the real 3d tools but it seems export as a one object(if character is wearing clothes, you cannot separate them). These tools can be used for example of concept, sketch, or mood board. It wasn't satisfactory to use for actual work
