### Evaluation of Tools
**Claude**
1. Did contain the word I requested. The format of writing was not a essay format.
2. Matched the format but the word count was not(761 words). The flow was similar to that I planed it, but it needs more detail.
3. It does not have access to the internet links, cannot process img file in pdf. Therefore there are some obstacle to get a exact definition or content user planed. 
4. Expexted new flow for the content, but 1,2, and 4 output was very similar. Example were changed but metaphor or structures are very same.

- If there are no findings, the frequency of making words is less than that of GPT
- Tone was more less ai then GPT
- Branded Ui seems very delicate, felt like Claude is more focused on the writing(human language) not problem solving(coding, anwsering questions)
- It does not seem the understand the prompt very well.

**Chat GPT 4**
1. Did contain the word I requested. The format of writing was not a essay format.
2. Matched the format but the word count was not(582 words). The flow was similar to that I planed it, but it needs more detail.
3. Cannot process img file in pdf. Can access the links, when there are no answer it still gave me the result with related link.
4. Tones are slightly changing. Very strict to the propmt. It feels like essay is composed by with the given element.

- The tone was very GPT.
- It was like a reconstruction of the given data. Not a essay writing.

**Jenni Ai**
1. Provided introduction what would be good to include in each sentence
2. Similar to the 1. Just changed the examples
3. Cannot process img file in pdf. Can access the links. if it does not has any answers it says ‘can not find the answer’
4. Provide essay draft. Did not fit the word count

- Jenni Ai has two features. Prompt and writing section.
- On the prompt section, it recommend questions to ask related to the user input.
- On the writing, it automatically recommend related reference with link and APA style annotation.
- The way Jenni Ai generate the content is different from Claude and Chat GPT 4. It start with prompt base, but it generate text sentence by sentence. Which means it generate one sentence, asks for 'Accept' or 'Customize'.



**Key Challenges**
- Hard to fit the word count.
- Need to guide structure for the essay and write specifically.


### Conclusion
It is great for subtool. Easy to get an idea or get help when user start writng. However depends on the database and detail of the prompt, the quailty and output are vary. In particular, in the case of Chat GPT and Claude, the answer was slightly different when Ai checked whether if it knew the reference or not. Also when I ask a question related to a given reference, there are cases where it finds the similar answer. Therefor the user must judge the reliability by theirmself and write. Because of reliability of the reference, I really liked jenny ai. B
ecause when jenny ai used their own reference, it provided APA style annotation with link of certain reference.
Overall, I would use Jenni ai when I have to the the writing. Because with this tool, I can get overall ideas of structure and the content, grammar check, and reference recommendation.
