**Research Question/Goal**: How can AI analysis tool can reduce the time and procedure required for analysis and find correlations between data?

### AI Tools Researched 

1. Claude bot by Anthropic for iterative question generation 
2. Grok for survey creation and optimizing response bias errors
3. ChatGPT for high-level script ideation 

### Implementation & Testing

The following steps were completed with each of the AI tools researched:

- Generate a high-level overview of key topics and questions to cover in a website usability study interview script
- Generate initial interview questions focused on website usability issues 
- Selected 15 relevant, non-biased questions for further refinement
- Run a bias analysis on each question
- Refined questions further based on the reduction of error score
- Created final 10-question interview script

### Evaluation of Tools

**ChatGPT**

- Generated a broad overview of website usability study direction but lacked question specifics
- Struggled to provide relevant, unbiased questions tied to qualitative insights
- No capability for bias checking or refinement

**Claude**

- Provided relevant initial questions, but some lacked enough nuance
- No analysis of bias, but allowed manual selection of best questions
- Refinement relies fully on human effort rather than AI-assistance
