## Survey Data Analysis by AI

**Research Question/Goal**: How can AI analysis tool can reduce the time and procedure required for analysis and find correlations between data?

### AI Tools Researched 

1. Microsoft Survey
2. Chat GPT4
3. Other AI generators

### Implementation & Testing

The following steps were completed with each of the AI tools researched:

- Upload survey response data

- Generate a high-level overview of key topics and questions to cover in a website usability study interview script
- Generate initial interview questions focused on website usability issues 
- Selected 15 relevant, non-biased questions for further refinement
- Run a bias analysis on each question
- Refined questions further based on the reduction of error score
- Created final 10-question interview script

### Evaluation of Tools

**ChatGPT**

- Generated a broad overview of website usability study direction but lacked question specifics
- Struggled to provide relevant, unbiased questions tied to qualitative insights
- No capability for bias checking or refinement

**Claude**

- Provided relevant initial questions, but some lacked enough nuance
- No analysis of bias, but allowed manual selection of best questions
- Refinement relies fully on human effort rather than AI-assistance

**Others: Ask Zia, Survey Vista**

- Provided relevant initial questions, but some lacked enough nuance
- No analysis of bias, but allowed manual selection of best questions
- Refinement relies fully on human effort rather than AI-assistance

Overall, the tools showed differentiation in their scope - broad ideation vs bias checking vs manual refinement. Layering them addressed blindspots but with some repetition of efforts. 

### Key Challenges

- Misalignment between tools' specific capabilities 
- Some inaccurate or irrelevant questions generated 

### Conclusion:

AI-assisted prompt development shows strong potential for accelerating the initial phases of UX research planning with further iterations. Combining multiple tools helps offset individual limitations through a hybrid approach. Intent tuning is essential for relevance.
